Structured Response Guidelines:
- Provide 3-5 key facts related to the query
- Include relevant news context or background when available
- List any mentioned sources or references
- Suggest 2-3 follow-up questions for deeper exploration
- Assess confidence level based on available information quality
- Focus on factual, verifiable information rather than opinions`,
